# Intermediate Datasets

The 02_intermediate folder is intended to store intermediate datasets in your local machine.

**Medication Group:** A data set was created from information provided by the project partner team containing all the medications mapped to a higher-level category. This reduced the overall count of medications enabling the plotting and visualization of the analytics to be more manageable and concise. This reference data set, MedicationGroups, contains 32 rows and has Group Name associated with each medication. This is later merged with the Medications+Patients intermediate data set in the applicable analytics scripts.

To obtain thes *MedicationsPatients-Intermediate.csv* dataset you will need to run the notebook called *S-2-6-0-20210308-mdl-daen690-IntermediateDataset-Medications-Pat.ipynb* after adding the raw dataset (i.e., 20210225-ems-raw-v04.xlsx) in the 01_Raw folder.

**Procedure Group:** A data set was created from information provided by the project partner team containing all the procedures mapped to a higher-level category. This reduced the overall count of procedures allowing the plotting and visualization of the analytics more manageable and concise. This reference data set, ProcedureGroups, contains 68 rows and has Group Name associated with each procedure. This is later merged with the Procedures+Patients intermediate data set in the applicable analytics scripts.

To obtain these *ProceduresPatients-Intermediate.csv* dataset you will need to run the notebook called *S-2-6-0-20210308-mdl-daen690-IntermediateDataset-Procedures-Pat.ipynb* after adding the raw dataset (i.e., 20210225-ems-raw-v04.xlsx) in the 01_Raw folder.
